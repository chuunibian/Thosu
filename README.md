# Thosu project
This game was developed to further my experience with OOP and C++ with some introduction to graphics and game design. This game combines the bullet hell elements of the Touhou series with precision clicking
elements of the game Osu currently a work in progress.

(WIP):
Currently the code for the base game class and classes regarding player and worldbackground have been completed. Classes for player and worldbackground were designed to be easily changed
to allow the addition of new content for new levels.
