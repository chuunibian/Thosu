# Thosu project
Author: Austin Bian
This game was developed to further my experience with OOP and C++ with some introduction to graphics and game design. This game combines the bullet hell elements of the Touhou series with precision clicking
elements of the game Osu currently a working in progress. (WIP)

This game features animations and edited sprites.
